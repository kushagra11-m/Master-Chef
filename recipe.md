To make the dough by hand:
Place the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the honey and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Allow this to set for five minutes. The mixture will start to foam and bubble.
Add the oil, flour, and salt, and stir until a shaggy dough forms.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about five minutes until a smooth dough ball is created.
Transfer the dough ball to a greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
To make the dough in a bread machine:
Combine ingredients in the bread machine pan according to the order recommended by your machineâ€™s manufacturer.
Set on "dough" and start the machine, checking after ten minutes to make sure all the ingredients have been incorporated and not stuck to the side of the pan. Scrape down any stray ingredients.
To make the dough in a stand mixer:
Place the warm water in the mixing bowl. Stir in the honey and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Allow this to set for five minutes. The mixture will start to foam and bubble.
Add the oil, flour, and salt.
With the dough hook, stir the mixture on low until a smooth, elastic dough ball forms. Scrape down the sides, if needed.
Transfer the dough ball to a greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
Once the dough is ready:
Grease four 12-inch pizza screens or prepare four baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper or greasing and then sprinkling with corn meal.
When the dough is ready, divide it into four equal portions. Shape each portion into a flat, 12-inch round. Place each on a prepared pan and proceed with your pizza recipe, adding your preferred sauce and toppings. Bake at 475 degrees for 8 to 12 minutes, until the crust is crisp and the cheese is melted.
Notes
To freeze the dough: divide the dough into portions BEFORE it finishes its first rise cycle in the bread machine, about 20 minutes into it, if making dough by hand. Place each dough ball into a plastic sandwich bag and freeze immediately. To use later, remove the frozen dough ball from the packaging and allow to rise in a greased dish in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for about 6 hours.
Nutritional values apply to ONE 12-inch pizza.
If you would like to prepare just enough dough for ONE pizza, adjust the number of servings in the recipe card to adjust the ingredients.
